It's not uncommon to use a `UICollectionView` to show a grid of items in a view and use Interface Builder to configure it's to fit a particular phone width. Unfortunately we no longer have a single phone width to worry about and if we use this static layout on a wider iPhone such as an iPhone 6, the standard behaviour of a `UICollectionViewFlowLayout` is to increase the spacing between the cells. What is often prefferable is for the collection view's cell size to grow, leaving the gap the same across different device sizes.

## The solution

We can use a simple custom `UICollectionViewFlowLayout` to solve this problem. In our layout subclass we overrde the `prepareLayout` method to calculate a new `itemSize` that best fits the collection view's width.

``` swift

class CustomLayout: UICollectionViewFlowLayout {
    
    
    var numberOfItemsPerRow: Int = 3 {
        didSet {
            invalidateLayout()
        }
    }
    
    
    override func prepareLayout() {
        super.prepareLayout()
        
        if let collectionView = self.collectionView {
            var newItemSize = itemSize

            // Always use an item count of at least 1
            let itemsPerRow = CGFloat(max(numberOfItemsPerRow, 1))
            
            // Calculate the sum of the spacing between cells
            let totalSpacing = minimumInteritemSpacing * (itemsPerRow - 1.0)
            
            // Calculate how wide items should be
            newItemSize.width = (collectionView.bounds.size.width - totalSpacing) / itemsPerRow
            
            // Use the aspect ratio of the current item size to determine how tall the items should be
            if itemSize.height > 0 {
                let itemAspectRatio = itemSize.width / itemSize.height
                newItemSize.height = newItemSize.width / itemAspectRatio
            }
            
            // Set the new item size
            itemSize = newItemSize
        }
    }
}

```

As an added bonus, you could easily extend this layout to support a different number of items per row based on it's orientaion. You could even add more items per row if the item size becomes too large.
